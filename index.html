            <p>Hey you have been the best girlfriend that I've ever had
                this year. I am so grateful for your presence and
                everything you have done for me. This year definitely
                was a tough one and next year will definitely be too.
                But I know that it will be much more comforting than before
                knowing that you will be there for me no
                matter what and after every experience we have encounted
                together as a couple. No this is not a proposal. So, will you
                be my valentine?!?!?!??!!!
                (You can't say no)</p>
